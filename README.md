# Covid-19-Exploratory-data-analysis
In this Project performed the Exploratory Data analysis to answer some queries regarding problems faced by hospitals and government due to people migration in India. Also tried to gain insights from the data sets.

### Queries:
1. News has Reported that, Covid-19is more likely to affect elder population as compared to the youth, is that true?
2. The Prime Minister has asked you to plan the migration plans of the labour's as it has become a huge problem, we want them to get the facilities but we have limited resources in cities, how will you handle this situation?
3. Possible Counter - We have some of the states which has a much higher number of hospitals and so we can start with moving labour's to Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka and in a similar ratio to places with enough medical facilities. But an we be sure of the capacity or hospitals from the numbers?
4. Does Every City needs to evacuate the daily wage workers from the cities?
5. Private Hospitals Cost of Treatment is Unaffordable for the Labours, Does all the above queries change there result when we try to focus on public hospitals as hospitals for the poor ?

These are the Queries which I've Tried to solve using the data visualisation libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn.

Please check the Jupyter Notebook for better understanding.
